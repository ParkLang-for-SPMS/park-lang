# park-lang
ParkLang is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed for Smart Parking Management Systems (SPMS). It enables users to generate three C4 model viewpoints: Context, Container, and Component. ParkLang provides a structured environment for software architecture design and supports model-driven development.

## About

**ParkLang** is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed specifically for modelling Smart Parking Management Systems (SPMS). It streamlines creation of software architecture artifacts by enabling automatic generation of three C4 viewpoints and by supporting model exchange using MetaEdit+ `*.mxt` (metamodel) and `*.mxm` (model) formats.

## Features

- Define SPMS concepts with a tailored metamodel.
- Generate three C4 viewpoints automatically:
  - Context
  - Container
  - Component
- Export and import:
  - Metamodel: `.mxt` (Metamodel Exchange Template)
  - Models: `.mxm` (Model Exchange Format)
- Sample models included to demonstrate typical SPMS architectures.

## C4 Viewpoints

ParkLang produces the following C4 viewpoints for architecture documentation:

1. **Context** — high-level actors, systems and relationships.  
2. **Container** — containers (web apps, services, databases) and their responsibilities.  
3. **Component** — internal components of a container and their interactions.

These views facilitate communication with stakeholders and support both design and documentation workflows.
