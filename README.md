## About

**ParkLang** is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed for Smart Parking Management Systems (SPMS). It enables users to automatically generate three viewpoints of the C4 model—Context, Container, and Component—and provides a valuable environment for software architecture design. ParkLang streamlines the creation of architectural artifacts and supports model exchange through MetaEdit+ using the Metamodel Exchange Template (.mxt) and Model Exchange Format (.mxm) files, both of which are included in this repository along with sample models.

## Features

- Define SPMS concepts with a tailored metamodel.
- Generate three C4 viewpoints:
  - Context
  - Container
  - Component
- Export and import:
  - Metamodel: `.mxt` (Metamodel Exchange Template)
  - Models: `.mxm` (Model Exchange Format)
- Sample models included to demonstrate typical SPMS architectures.

## C4 Viewpoints

ParkLang produces the following C4 viewpoints for architecture documentation:

1. **Context** — high-level actors, systems and relationships.  
2. **Container** — containers (web apps, services, databases) and their responsibilities.  
3. **Component** — internal components of a container and their interactions.

These views facilitate communication with stakeholders and support both design and documentation workflows.
